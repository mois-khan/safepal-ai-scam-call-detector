Scam and spam calls are a growing threat, where fraudsters impersonate banks, government 
officials, or relatives to trick people into revealing sensitive information (like OTPs, bank details, 
or passwords). 
Most victims fail to recognize such calls in real time. 

**Problem**: Users currently have no intelligent system that listens to calls in real time, 
analyzes conversations, and alerts them during the ongoing call if it’s potentially a scam. 
Project Idea 

We propose an AI-powered Real-Time Scam Call Detection System: 

• When a phone call starts, the app automatically activates. 
• It listens to both sides of the call in real time. 
• It performs: 
1. Speaker separation (Caller vs Receiver). 
2. Speech-to-text transcription (live captions). 
3. Scam detection analysis using an LLM (or custom classifier).
   
• If suspicious activity is detected (e.g., asking for OTP, impersonating bank/government), 
the system will:

o Alert the user immediately with a live warning notification. 

o Continue to provide transcriptions and analysis during the call. 

This system will protect innocent users from fraud by combining speech recognition, NLP, 
and real-time alerting.
